# âš½ Players Injured Project (Java)

This project is a **Java implementation of the approach of Naive Bayesâ€“style classifier** designed to predict whether a player will be **injured** or **not injured** based on their training and match history.  

NOTE : Naives Bayes classifier was not used in the project, just replicates how it works.

The classifier uses a **frequency-based approach**: it learns from training data stored in a CSV file, counts the frequency of outcomes ("Yes" for injured, "No" for not injured) for each feature combination, and makes predictions based on the majority outcome.  

It also supports **in-memory training**, **accuracy evaluation**, and **dynamic dataset updates**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Train the classifier directly from a CSV file  
- âœ… Store the full dataset in memory for further learning and evaluation  
- âœ… Predict injury status (`Yes` or `No`) based on player attributes  
- âœ… Dynamically add new training examples without reloading the CSV  
- âœ… Evaluate classifier accuracy using a **train/test split**  
- âœ… Debug and inspect **frequency tables** used by the model
